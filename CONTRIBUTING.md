# How to contribute to Klaytn DApp Toolkit

We are really glad that you are reading this. We need more volunteer developers and contributors to make this DApp Toolkit come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

- [Klaytn Docs](https://docs.klaytn.foundation) - Complete technical specifications about Klaytn Blockchain,
- [Klaytn Developer](https://developer.klaytn.foundation) - is the Developer Information Hub and a great starting point for you to build on Klaytn
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/klaytnofficial) - is our discussion hub if you encounter any issues or have any questions

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
