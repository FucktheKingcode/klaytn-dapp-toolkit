## FAQ
### Why copy/paste and not packaged as a container app?
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components of your DApp are built.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize all the codes to your needs.

One of the drawback of other opinionated tools is that they often stick to one technical stack which might not fit for everyone.

### Do you plan to publish it as a container app?
Not at the moment.

### Which frameworks are supported?
You can use any development framework that supports EVM. For example, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org), [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/).
