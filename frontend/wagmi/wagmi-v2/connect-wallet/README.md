> Choose the frameworks that you use and check out the code snippets

## web3modal
The Web3Modal SDK allows you to easily connect your Web3 dapp with wallets. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.

Web3Modal support for Wagmi v2 is still beta so you will encounter some issues, especially with Nextjs 14 App router which relies on SSR and RSC.
