## Wagmi v1
Wagmi is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with EVM chains. Wagmi makes it easy to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more â€” all with caching, request deduplication, and persistence.
